Study of human bhevaior began in BCs

1. Aristotle:
	> 350BC
	> importance on empirical observations

2. Rene decartes
	> 1600s
	>"I think, therefore I am"
	> Mind body dualism. (mind and matter are fundamentally different kind of substances)

Early studies to study mind:

1. Franciscus Donders
"How long does it take to make a decison"
	1. Press key when seeing a light
	2. Press j on left light, k on right light.
	> difference is time for decision

2. Wilhelm Wundt - Structuralism
	>**** Father of psychology
	> Structuralism
	> Combined basic sensations to create experinece.
	> Red fruit - apple
	> Analytical Introspection - Asked the participants what their thought process was.

3. William James  - Functionalism
	> Observed his own mind operation
	> Functionalism
	> First harvard course on psychology
	> Attention - not everything enters our experinece
	> Filter Detector model

---Abandoning Study of Mind and focus on external behaviour:

	> Conditioning


4. Behaviourism - John B. Watson - conditionng
	> John B. Watson
	> Abandon mind. Focus on observable behaviour.
	> What relation b/w stimulii and BEHAVOiOUR. Not mind.

	> Classical Conditioning - Little Albert Expt. 
	> Pair rats with loud bang. Child started fearing Rats.

	> Pavlov Dogs

5. Operant Conditioning - B F Skinner
	
	> Another tool for studying stimulus and response - Operant conditioning.
	> Rewards to increase good Behaviour, Punishments to decrease a behaviour.

	Classic Conditioning - Just repeat the instances
	Operant Conditioning - Rewards and punishments to + - beahaviour


L6:


1. Cognitive Behaviousrim
	> Both thinking and conditioning to explain behaviour
	> You visit a free streaming site
	> Behaviourists : You visit the website, because u are rewqrded from watching it
	> Cognitive behaviourist : Also because they are free!

2. Gestalt Psychology - Max Wertheimer:
	> Whole is greater than sum of parts.
	> Gestalt not scientist name. It means "put together"

3. PsycoAnalytic Psychology: - Sigmund Freud
	> Many unconscious thioughts are repressed.
	> Nothing is accident. If we search engouhg, every action/thought has reason
	> We are ruled by unconscious forces.

4. Humanistic Psychology
	> maslow. Rejected freud idea of being controlled by unconscious forces.
	> Also uncomfortable with behavioursts view on conditioning.
	> Didnt accpet the determinism in these view. The idea that our actions are out of our control. LAMEsies

5. Edward C. Tolman
	> Rat in maze. Runs left or right, intelligent
	> Used behavrious to infer mental processes


Congnitive revolution - Again Study of Mind:

	> child say many sentencees which are not rewarded (opposite to operant conditioning)
	> Use behaviours to study working of mind.

	> Shift in psychology from bhehaviourist to study of mind.
	> Mind processes the stimulus (like a computer!)

	input -> processing -> response

	> Dichotic Listening Task (audio in 2 ears)
	> Listen the unattedned sound, but unaware of contents
	> Implies we have a kind of filter into our mind.


	> John McCarthy, said to build a intelligent machine.

	> George Miller : No. of items processes by human = 7 +- 2 == 5~9 items




L7:

Cognitive Psychology:
 > Branch that focuses on thw way people process information
 > What in our minds that links stimulii and resopnse

 Modern Research :
	 1. How research goes from one Q to another - Following a trail
	 2. The models of mind.

The mind creates and controls mental functions such as 
	Perception
	Attention
	Memory
	Rmotion
	Language
	Thinking
	Reasoning
	Deciding

The questions of how the mind achieves what it does is what Cognitive Psychology answers


Ebbinghaus's Memory experiment:
	<slide 52, L5-7>
	> Ebinghaus's saving curves
	> Learn senseless syllabes once. Give time gap. Learn again. 
	> Time difference is the saving (amount remembered)
	> Falls rapidly till 2 days. and levels out. 

Note how we are using behaviour measures to study the mind properties



When we are under pressure, we use more working memory capacity


Chocking experiment:

	> High Working Memory people are more suseptible to Chocking
	> Low working memory people are doing better in chocking condition

	> Because LWM guys use shortcuts and HWM ppl use genuine routes (more working memory needed).
