Cognitive neuroscience
	> Study of physiological basis of cognition.

Lets study Physiology!

Neurons:
	
	Dendrite : recieve signal from other neurons.
	Axon	 : Send signal to other neurons.
	Schwan cell: keeps the nerve fiber alive, and create myliene sheathe
	Myline sheet : insulator in conduction

Synapse : structures are b/w one axon and another dendron. Permits neuron to pas electricyt from one to another.

Action Potential : The change in potential that occurs b/w inside and outside of a nerve or muscle fiber, when it is stimulated. Serving to transmit nerve signals.

> Stimulation should reach a threshold. -55mV. (To open Na gates).Otherwise failed initiaiton.
> Refractory period after stimulation.


L9:

> Refractory period after stimulation.

> 3 Na+ ions out, for every 2 K+ ions inside. Hence potential difference.
> Potassium channels are slow to open and close, causing the potential differences. if not, they'd be settled instantaneously.

Feature Detectors in retina:
	> area of retina, specific stimulus response - orientation, movement, length.
	> Oriented bar, oriented moving bar, small bar moving.
	> Hubel and Wiesel, Nobel Prize. Meh!

> Temporal lobe -> Fusiform area for face images.
	> WHAT pathway for perception

- hiearchial processing.

> Cognitive Neuropsychology  : 
	study of patients with brain damagae (due to stroke, cutoff blood supply).


1. Paul Broca : 
	> Patient named :"Tan". Able to speak only "Tan"
	> Left frontal lobe area damaged. 
	> Broca's area. Associated with speech.

2.
	> Patient didn't understand langauge. But spoke nicely but incoherent.
	> Temporal Lobe damage. Wernicke's area.
	> Temporal Lobe associated with WHAT pathway.
	> Temporal Lobe is inside area of brain. Inside and bottom.

3.
	> Occipital lobe damage. Vision gone.
	> Left lobe damgaed, right eye vision gone.

4. Prosopagnosia

	> Can't recognize faces. Damage to lower temproal lobe. Fusiform area...


fMRI:
	> Active brain regin has more blood flow.

	BOLD : blood oxygen level dependent
	> MRI works cause, Fe+2 in blood aligns with marnetic field.
	> Deoxygenated Fe+2 even more so!

	> Use to detect which region of brain localized for which task - stimulus.
