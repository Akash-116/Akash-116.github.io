L1:
Overt behaviours : Directly observable
Covert behaviour : thinking, dreaming, remembering

L2:
Common sense can be vaugely incorrect because, we as everyday observers have limited exposure. And also, we don't think much, before making a generalisation.

Common sense works best after the fact! Haha...

L3:

Suspicions confirmed by scientific observations. We also get extra insights.

Dreams study carried out by EEG - ElectroEncephaloGraph.

Four stages of sleep :- 
1. NREM Stage1
2. NREM stage2 (brain produces sleep spindles: sudden burst of oscillatory brain activity generated in thalamus)
3. NREM stage3
4.** dreams -  REM sleep (brain becomes more active. Rapid eye movement occurs)

Pseudopsychologies:
	> false phycologies with no scientific base or falsifying evidences.

	Phrenology : traits determined by shape of skull.
	Palmistry  : lines on hand reveal future.
	Graphology : study of handwriting for persons character (select job candidates)
	Astrology  : stars at birth determine character.

The Barnum effect : 
	WHen a astrological description contains both good and bad descripitons (in general terms), it may sound correct. Because, our mind gives personal meaning to general sattements.

L4:

The scientific method has 6 satges:
	Making observatoins
	Defining a problem
	Making a hypothesis
	Gather eivence / test ur hopythesis
	theory building **
	publish results.

we might have to give operational definitions to things like frustation, anger. For frustation "Number of times we interrupt a guy from sipping a drink." Angry "no. of times he insults us"

Covert Behaviours are operationally definded in terms of overt behaviours.


Ethical concerns in behavioural psychology are:
	Use of deception
	Invasion of privacy
	risk of lasting harm

Milgram Experiment:
	> Testing for Obedience
	> Shock given by participants to others
	> Learner - Mr. Wallace (confederate,  gets the shock)
	> Teacher (the volunteer, gives the shock)
	> expermineter - Mr. Williams
	Result :-
		> 65% continued to highest voltage 450 volts.
		> Others stopped at 300
	Conclusion :-
		> Ordinary people follow orders from authorities. Obiedence is ingrained in us. This obedience to legitimate authority is learnt in home, school, work-place etc.

Milgram agency theory:
1. autonomic state.
2. Agentic state (pass off resbionbility to others. Act like agent to others  will.)
